# Blackjack Game


## Application Description
This application is a simplified blackjack game that can help the user learn blackjack through an in depth reccomendation system along with a substantial initial betting amount. 



I use PyCharm and essentially just run the blackjack.py file, which launches the game and allows the user to play. Currently there is no executable or method of saving the game.
